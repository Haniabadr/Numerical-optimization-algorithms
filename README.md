# Numerical-optimization-algorithms

# Description:
#### This repository contains five files for Numerical optimization algorithms **all implemented from scratch** with linear regression
* **(single and multivariate Batch gradient descent with linear regression)** for the multivariate vectorized implementation was used, this file uses both datasets in data folder <br>
* **Single variable Batch,mini-batch and stochastic GD with linear regression** <br>
* **Single variable Momentum and NAG optimizers with linear regression** <br>
* **Single variable Adagrad,RMSProp and Adam optimizers with linear regression** <br>
* **Multivariate batch and mini batch Adam** vectorized implementation <br>
